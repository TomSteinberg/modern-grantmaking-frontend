This is plain HTML and CSS, no dependencies necessary.

I've used Sass (https://sass-lang.com) for CSS compilation - but you don't have to, the fully compiled and edited CSS file is available in global.css

If you are using Sass, the compilation command I've used is

`sass --watch --style compressed sass:css`
