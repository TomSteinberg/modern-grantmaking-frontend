    <p class="lede">Our forthcoming book is for anyone who is employed in the curious world of grantmaking, whether you work for a private foundation, a government funder, or a corporate donor.</p>
    <hr class="hr-one" />
    <p>Grantmaking is such an unusual occupation - giving away freaking money - that we have encountered people who don’t believe that anyone actually gets paid to do it. But grantmaking is a real job, and if you’re reading this, then the odds are that it’s your real job.</p>
    <p>Our aim in writing this book was to produce a practical guide that grantmakers can open whenever they are looking for some support. To make it quick and easy to use, we’ve filled the book with answers to real-world grantmaking questions.</p>

    <h2>Does this book have an agenda?</h2>
    <div class="two-cols">
      <p>Oh yes. We believe that a lot of what we call ‘traditional grantmaking’ needs reform. We’re not alone - the book is full of stories of grantmakers who aren’t content with the status quo, and whose work is increasingly driven by values such as humility, equity, and service.</p>
      <p>We think that a lot of the criticism that grantmaking gets - especially from grantees and grantseekers - is justified. This is despite the fact that funding organisations employ many talented and hard-working people, including some of our dearest friends. </p>
      <p>We believe grantmaking is a field of mostly dedicated souls trapped within creaking systems and outdated conventions.  </p>
      <p>However, despite being critical about some current practices, we don’t believe that the solution is to tear down grantmaking and salt the earth.</p>
      <p>We want to encourage more people who work in grantmaking to think of themselves as being reformers of the profession, as well as employees. This is what Modern Grantmaking is about: doing the job well, and changing the job at the same time.</p>
